C:\andapps\netplus\android\app\build.gradle:44: Warning: A newer version of org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7 than 1.9.22 is available: 2.1.0 [GradleDependency]
    implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:1.9.22'
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

C:\andapps\netplus\android\app\src\main\res\drawable-v21: Warning: This folder configuration (v21) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 21. Merge all the resources in this folder into drawable. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

C:\andapps\netplus\android\app\src\main\res\mipmap-xxxhdpi\ic_launcher.png: Warning: Launcher icons should not fill every pixel of their square region; see the design guide for details [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your
   launcher icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional,
   front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that
   users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

C:\andapps\netplus\android\app\src\main\res\mipmap-anydpi-v26\ic_launcher.xml:2: Warning: The application adaptive icon is missing a monochrome tag [MonochromeLauncherIcon]
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "MonochromeLauncherIcon":
   If android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in your manifest, you must
   either remove the reference to android:roundIcon if it is not needed; or,
   supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the android:roundIcon
   and android:icon attribute.

   For example, if android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in the
   manifest, a launcher might choose to use android:roundIcon over
   android:icon to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed
   application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also
   specified in android:roundIcon.
