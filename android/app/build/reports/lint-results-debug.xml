        summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

        message="This folder configuration (`v21`) is unnecessary; `minSdkVersion` is 21. Merge all the resources in this folder into `drawable`."
        category="Performance"
        priority="6"
        summary="Obsolete SDK_INT Version Check"
        explanation="This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the `minSdkVersion` (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high as the version checked for.&#xA;&#xA;Similarly, it also looks for resources in `-vNN` folders, such as `values-v14` where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the `minSdkVersion`, where the contents should be merged into the best folder.">

        explanation="According to the Android Design Guide (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your launcher icons should &quot;use a distinct silhouette&quot;, a &quot;three-dimensional, front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that users perceive some depth.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a filled square.">

        explanation="If `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` are both in your manifest, you must either remove the reference to `android:roundIcon` if it is not needed; or, supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` attribute.&#xA;&#xA;For example, if `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` are both in the manifest, a launcher might choose to use `android:roundIcon` over `android:icon` to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also specified in `android:roundIcon`."
